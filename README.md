## My process

After following my first HTML/CSS course on [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com), I'm now trying to master deeper some skills. After coding the HTML part, the real "challenge" for me was to adjust correctly the page with the following CSS properties  padding, margin, justify-content, align-items...  

### Feedbacks

I really want to progress in CSS in particular, so don't be shy to give feedbacks, whatever the subject !
